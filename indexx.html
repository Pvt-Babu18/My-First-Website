          <h3>Computer Engineering</h3>
          <p class="text-small">
            Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is an academic programme that
            integrates the field of Computer Engineering and Computer Science.
            It is one of the most sought after courses amongst engineering
            students. The course contains a plethora of topics but emphasises
            the basics of computer programming and networking. The topics
            covered in the course are computation, algorithms, programming
            languages, program design, computer software, computer hardware, and
            others. Computer science engineers are involved in many aspects of
            computing, from the design of individual microprocessors, personal
            computers, and supercomputers to circuit designing and writing
            software that powers them. Many technical institutes in India and
            abroad offer UG (Undergraduate) and PG (Postgraduate) level courses
            in Computer Science Engineering. Students can do BTech and MTech in
            Computer Science Engineering from these institutes. Students
            pursuing these courses get to learn about the design,
            implementation, and management of information systems of computer
            hardware and software.
